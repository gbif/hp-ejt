## What is EJT?

The European Journal of Taxonomy is a fully refereed, international, fully electronic open access journal in descriptive taxonomy, covering subjects in zoology (including entomology), botany (in its broadest sense), and palaeontology.

It provides immediate free open access to its content on the principle that making research freely available to the public supports and encourages a greater global exchange of knowledge.

## Journal History

The European Journal of Taxonomy was initiated by a task force of six people from the [EDIT](http://www.e-taxonomy.eu/) (European Distributed Institute of Taxonomy) network who worked together from June 2009 to September 2011 to propose a joint journal that would solve some of the issues identified in shifting from paper to e-only publishing for institutional journals in taxonomy. The task force was given a mandate by the EDIT directors to investigate the need for and feasibility of launching such a joint e-journal. After their investigation, the task force presented a business model involving natural history institutions (NHIs). Five NHIs (National Museum of Natural History, Paris, France; Meise Botanic Garden, Meise, Belgium; Royal Museum for Central Africa, Tervuren, Belgium; Natural History Museum, London, United Kingdom; Institute of Natural Sciences, Brussels, Belgium) offer their financial support and/or their in-kind support (skilled publishing staff, IT staff), which provides autonomy for the journal. After a proofing period of the publishing model, workflow model and editorial team organisation, the first article was published on September 9th 2011.

Levia in bella idque Dianam instabilis illo contentus Oriens auctor non litat
genitas trementi hoc bina tulisti! Tuae at aequor!

### Turbatque promittat memorque

Ne arvis relinquit ossibus deus. Superis et oppugnare suo armis? Adfata nec
lavit sed disces cum surgimus peteret gladios; pabula. Quod vos fugit, manebat
dum: fateor profugus renovatus exhalantem.

## Est mea videndo

Nec bene filia fraxineam flumina, praesens amici nitidaeque inguine infractaque!
Non quae illuc! E alto cum quod: fessi fatum patulis ore actaque quaque, ore.
Honor praemia veniunt violavit tu

dependent artisque audacem habuissem, et est rebus, sed?
