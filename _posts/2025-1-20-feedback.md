[As we explained a short while ago](https://ejt.hp.gbif-staging.org/post/2025/launch/), the GBIF hosted portal for the European Journal of Taxonomy is now live.

We'd love to hear from users about this new tool designed for the community. You can submit your suggestions on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbif/hp-ejt/issues) or by email at [ejteditorialoffice@gmail.com](mailto:ejteditorialoffice@gmail.com).

You can also report errors directly from the dataset/occurrence pages or at [sautter@plazi.org](mailto:sautter@plazi.org) so that they can be corrected as soon as possible.
