[As explained in a previous post](https://data.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/post/2025/launch/), the GBIF-hosted portal for the European Journal of Taxonomy is now live.

We'd love to hear from users about this new tool designed for the community. You can submit your suggestions on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbif/hp-ejt/issues) or at [ejteditorialoffice@gmail.com](mailto:ejteditorialoffice@gmail.com).

You can also report data errors directly from the dataset/occurrence pages or on [GitHub](https://github.com/plazi/community/issues) so that they will be corrected in due course.
