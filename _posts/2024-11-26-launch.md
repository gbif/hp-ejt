**We are pleased to announce the launch of the GBIF hosted portal for the European Journal of Taxonomy.**

From the beginning, the European Journal of Taxonomy has committed to ensuring the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR principles) of its data.

In 2017, the consortium partnered with the non-profit organization Plazi to retroconvert the metadata of articles published since 2011 in PDF format, along with the taxonomic treatments and material citations they contain, into XML Taxpub format. The articles, as well as the associated elements are deposited in the Biodiversity Literature Repository (Zenodo) to be disseminated across various relevant databases as the GBIF.
