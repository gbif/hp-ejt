[As we explained a short while ago](https://ejt.hp.gbif-staging.org/post/2024/launch/), the GBIF hosted portal for the European Journal of Taxonomy is now live.

We'd love to hear from users about this new tool designed for the community. You can submit your suggestions [here](https://github.com/gbif/hp-ejt/issues) or by email at [ejteditorialoffice@gmail.com](mailto:ejteditorialoffice@gmail.com).

You can also report errors related to datasets and occurrences to [sautter@plazi.org](mailto:sautter@plazi.org) so it will be corrected as soon as possible.
