**The European Journal of Taxonomy, Plazi and GBIF are pleased to announce the launch of the first GBIF hosted portal dedicated to a journal.**

The [European Journal of Taxonomy](https://europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu) is a fully refereed, international, electronic open access journal in descriptive taxonomy, covering subjects in zoology (including entomology), botany (in its broadest sense), mycology, and paleontology.

It provides immediate free open access to its content on the principle that making research freely available to the public supports and encourages a greater global exchange of knowledge.

From the beginning, the European Journal of Taxonomy has committed to ensuring the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR principles) of its data.

In 2017, the consortium partnered with the non-profit organization [Plazi](https://plazi.org/) to retroconvert the metadata of articles published since 2011 in PDF format, along with the taxonomic treatments and material citations they contain, into XML Taxpub format. The articles, as well as the associated elements and data are deposited in the [Biodiversity Literature Repository](https://zenodo.org/communities/biosyslit) (Zenodo) to be disseminated across various relevant databases, such as [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) and [ChecklistBank](https://www.checklistbank.org/).

However, although 100% of EJT data was available on GBIF, until now it could only be retrieved through individual searches. This [new portal](https://data.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu) provides a unique view of the data published in EJT and made available on GBIF, making use of GBIFâ€™s powerful search and visualization tools.
